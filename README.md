I am a 4th-year Business Economics Student at UC Irvine. I am a self-starter that is aspiring to leverage my Business Economic analytical skills to break into a career in tech! More specifically, I would like to be a mobile app developer because I started to enjoy making mobile android apps after I took a course on mobile app development here at UC Irvine through a nonprofit organization called CodePath Org. I have a passion for learning new things to apply to my everyday life because I am a film believer that **knowledge is power**. I am a problem solver, passionate about uncovering the "why" in how things work, and want to make the world a better place for all!
