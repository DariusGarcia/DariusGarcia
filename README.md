I am a senior Business Economics student at UC Irvine. I am a self-starter that is driven to uncover the "why" in how things work.

More specifically, I'm interested in becoming a front-end web developer because I found a passion for programming after taking a course in native mobile Android app development here at UC Irvine through a nonprofit organization called CodePath Org. I fell in love with having to think outside the box for solving various problems and being able to let my creativity run freely. Since then, I have found a love for creating elegant apps to which I decided to push myself to start learning other programming languages and technologies to further increase my capabilities and to see where my creativity takes me.

I have a passion for learning new things to apply to my everyday life because I am a film believer that knowledge is power. I am a problem solver that wants to use my skills to help other people and to be able to make the world a better place for all!
