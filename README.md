I'm a recent UC Irvine graduate with a B.A. degree in Business Economics. I'm not afraid of failure as that's where *true* growth flourishes. I'm highly motivated and a fast learner.

I found a passion for programming due to having to think outside the box for solving various real world problems and being able to let my creativity run freely. I'm always trying to learn new technologies to further advance my capabilities to see where my imagination leads me.

I strive to keep learning new things to not only apply to my everyday life, but to <ins>constantly challenge what's possible.</ins> I try to refrain from accepting one approach of doing something, but rather try to seek comfort in embracing the *unknown* to be able to shed light on new solutions. I'm a problem solver that wants to utilize my skills to help other people and to make the world a better place for all.
