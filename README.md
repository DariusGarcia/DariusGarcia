I'm a recent UC Irvine graduate with a B.A. in Business Economics. I'm highly motivated and a fast learner.

I strive to keep learning new things to not only apply to my everyday life, but to <ins>constantly challenge what's possible.</ins> I'm a problem solver that wants to utilize my skills to help other people and to make the world a better place for all.
